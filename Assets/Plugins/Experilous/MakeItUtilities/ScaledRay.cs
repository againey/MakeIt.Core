	/// A ray with a direction vector that does not need to be a unit vector.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para><see cref="UnityEngine.Ray"/> requires that its direction vecotor be a unit vector.  Not only does
	/// this result in a performance cost when constructing a ray (the provided direction must be normalized, just
	/// in case), but it also precludes the use of a ray to represent a ray that propagates at a particular velocity,
	/// or a parametric line that has endpoints at t = 0 and t = 1.  Additionally, it is not marked as serializable,
	/// and thus cannot be used directly as a serialized field in a class.  The scaled ray solves all of these
	/// problems, at the expense of not guaranteeing a unit vector direction.</para>
