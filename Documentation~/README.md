# User's Manual

MakeIt.Core was originally part of MakeIt.Tile which used [Sandcastle](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB)
to format and build documentation in HTML format. The raw content for this
process is preserved in the [MakeIt.Tile repository](https://github.com/againey/MakeIt.Tile)
until it can be updated or trasferred to a different format, perhaps based on
markdown.

For now, you can refer to the online
[Make It Tile User's Manual > API Reference](https://experilous.com/1/product/make-it-tile/2.0/documentation/html/R_Project_API_Reference.htm)
for v2.0 from November 2016.
